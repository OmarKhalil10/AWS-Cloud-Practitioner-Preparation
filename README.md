# 1- Cloud Concepts

## The Internet

**How data transfered from browser to server and back?**
- Browser--Request-->ISP--Request-->Server---->Webhost--Packet-->Browser

## Cloud = Internet
Made up of copper wires and global network of billions of devices.

## AWS Cloud Computing
- It is the **on-demand** delivery of compute, database storage, application, and other IT resources.
- Utilize a **pay-as-you-go** model [pay only for what you use, when you use them].
- Inastantaneous Access.
- Access resources where and when you want.
- More flexible and affordable than **legacy IT infrastructre**.
- Affordable for organizations and individuals with **smaller budgets**.

## History of Cloud Computing
- 1950s **Mainframe Computing** [Central computers and Dump terminals].
- 1970s **Virtual Machines** [Hypervisors].

## Examples of Cloud Computing services aroud us
- Email
- Youtube
- Office 365
- Google Drive [with different tiers subscription]

## Questions
**Which technology provides oversight for the cloud?**
**Answer**
_hypervising_ Together with connectivity, hypervising is the enabling technology.

**What marks the origin of cloud computing, and when did it occur?**
_the development of mainframe computing in the 1950s_ Electronic computing begins here, and the idea of having multiple, dumb terminals started the idea of the cloud.

 ## Why to choose Cloud Computing for work?
 - No need for physical servers on cabling.
 - No need for server room setup or maintenance.
 - No hardware replacement or procurements.
 - Pay only when and what you consume [**Pay-as-you-go**].
 - **Scalability** Scale up or down instantaneously and only pay for waht you use.
 - Benefit from **Economy of scale**.

## Man Advantages of Cloud Computing:

1. Trade capital expense for variable expense.
2. Benefit from massive economies of scale.
3. Stop guessing capacity.
4. Increase speed and agility.
5. Stop spending money runnig and maintaining data centers.
6. Go global in minutes.

## Three-3 Main Cloud Computing Models
- SaaS [**Software**].
- PaaS [**Platform**].
- IaaS [**Infrastructure**].
  
**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**
- Basic building blocks.
- Most flexibility and management control.
- Closest to having traditional **on-premises** data center.

**Platform as a Service (PaaS)**
- Deploy and manage applications without worry. [Ex: Microsoft Azure web hosting - Google App Engine - Heroku].
- Execute programming languages to host applications.
- Less flexibility than IaaS, as **packages are _Preconstructed_**.

**Software as a Service (SaaS)**
- **"Completed Products"** managed by the service provider [Ex: Gmail - Outlook].
- Easy to use as **End-User**.
- Less flexibility.

## Complexity level
1- High [**IaaS**].
2- Mid [**PaaS**].
3- Low [**SaaS**].

## Cloud Deployment Models
- **Cloud** Delployment.
- **On-Premises** Deployment.
- **Hybrid** Deployment.
