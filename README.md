# Prepare for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C01) Certification Exam

# 1- Introduction to Cloud Computing

## The Internet

**How data transfered from browser to server and back?**
- Browser--Request-->ISP--Request-->Server---->Webhost--Packet-->Browser

## Cloud = Internet
Made up of copper wires and global network of billions of devices.

## AWS Cloud Computing
- It is the **on-demand** delivery of compute, database storage, application, and other IT resources.
- Utilize a **pay-as-you-go** model [pay only for what you use, when you use them].
- Inastantaneous Access.
- Access resources where and when you want.
- More flexible and affordable than **legacy IT infrastructre**.
- Affordable for organizations and individuals with **smaller budgets**.

## History of Cloud Computing
- 1950s **Mainframe Computing** [Central computers and Dump terminals].
- 1970s **Virtual Machines** [Hypervisors].

## Examples of Cloud Computing services aroud us
- Email
- Youtube
- Office 365
- Google Drive [with different tiers subscription]

## Questions
**Which technology provides oversight for the cloud?**
**Answer**
_hypervising_ Together with connectivity, hypervising is the enabling technology.

**What marks the origin of cloud computing, and when did it occur?**
_the development of mainframe computing in the 1950s_ Electronic computing begins here, and the idea of having multiple, dumb terminals started the idea of the cloud.

# 2- Cloud Computing Concepts

## Why to choose Cloud Computing for work?
 - No need for physical servers on cabling.
 - No need for server room setup or maintenance.
 - No hardware replacement or procurements.
 - Pay only when and what you consume [**Pay-as-you-go**].
 - **Scalability** Scale up or down instantaneously and only pay for waht you use.
 - Benefit from **Economy of scale**.

## Main 6 Advantages of Cloud Computing according to [AWS] _IMPORTANT_

1. Trade capital expense for variable expense.
2. Benefit from massive economies of scale.
3. Stop guessing capacity.
4. Increase speed and agility.
5. Stop spending money runnig and maintaining data centers.
6. Go global in minutes.

## Three-3 Main Cloud Computing Models
- SaaS [**Software**].
- PaaS [**Platform**].
- IaaS [**Infrastructure**].
  
**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**
- Basic building blocks.
- Most flexibility and management control.
- Closest to having traditional **on-premises** data center.

**Platform as a Service (PaaS)**
- Deploy and manage applications without worry. [Ex: Microsoft Azure web hosting - Google App Engine - Heroku].
- Execute programming languages to host applications.
- Less flexibility than IaaS, as **packages are _Preconstructed_**.

**Software as a Service (SaaS)**
- **"Completed Products"** managed by the service provider [Ex: Gmail - Outlook].
- Easy to use as **End-User**.
- Less flexibility.

## Complexity level
1. High [**IaaS**].
2. Mid [**PaaS**].
3. Low [**SaaS**].

## Cloud Deployment Models
- **Cloud** Delployment.
- **On-Premises** Deployment.
- **Hybrid** Deployment.

1. **Cloud Deployment**
- **100%** of IT infrastructure on the cloud.
- All applications migrated to or created in the cloud.
- Rmoves **roadblock** of costly and **time-consuming** procurement processes.

2. **On-Premises/Private Cloud Deployment**
- Use **Virtualization** to deploy resources in their **on-premises** data centers.
- Often looks like **Traditional** IT infrastructure.
- Does not provide a lot of benefits of cloud computing.
- Resources **Cannot** be accessed using the **internet** [this provide a very quick data access].
- Procide dedicated resources [no resource sharing with other companies].
- High Security.

3. **Hybrid Deployment**
- Connect **on-premises** technology with **cloud-based** resources.
- Great for established companies that are in the process of **migrating** over the cloud.
- Data **Partially** on the cloud, and **Partially** in the on-premises data centers.
- Use the **Cloud** as **Backup** and **disaster recovery solution**.

## We choose the best deployment model based on this features

1. **Cloud Deployment**
- Utilize **Flexibility** and **Affordability** of cloud computing.

2. **On-Premises/Private Cloud Deployment**
- High Security on-premises.
- High **Data Retrieval** speed.
- Virtualization of legacy resources.

3. **Hybrid Deployment**
- **Partially** on the cloud, and **Partially** in the on-premises data centers.

## Well-Architected Framework

[**Build the most secure, durable, efficient, and high-performing IT infrastructure possible**].

**_BEST PRACTICES_**

1. **Avoid Unnecessary Costs**
- Use only what you need.
- Reserve resources in advance.
- Continue to monitor for optimization.

2. **Reliability**
- Test disaster recovery settings.
- Incorporate redundancy.
- Have duplicate copies of resources.

3. **Efficiency**
- The **efficient use** of computing **resources** to **adjust** to system **requirements**.

4. **Security** [Information - System - Assests]
- Best practice should be **automated**.
- **Data** should be always **protected**.
- Enable **Traceability**.
- **Manage access**.

5. **Operational Excellence**
- Document everything.
- Refine operational procedures.
- Anticipate failure.
- Update processes.
- Learn from failures.

 6. **Sustainability**
 - Maximum performance from available resources.
 - Minimize required total resources.
 - Minimize **environmental** impact.
 - Have **lower footprints** and **more energy efficient** than typical **on-premises environments**
